# RxRelayJS
RxRelayJS is a TS/JS implementation of [Jake Wharton's RxRelay](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxRelay). `Relay` types are analogous to `Subject` types, but without the ability to call `complete()` or `error()`. Therefore, they are _stateless_ in the sense that they cannot enter a terminal state. 

The most common usecase of `Subject` is to bridge between non-reactive APIs and reactive APIs. Typically, you do not want these bridges to enter any terminal state. The `Relay` types remove the possibility of this accidentally occuring.

## Installation
Via NPM:
```sh
npm install rxrelayjs
```

Note: The `rxjs` package is listed as a required peerDependency.

## Usage
RxRelayJS contains `Relay` types for each `Subject` type:
1. `Relay`
2. `BehaviorRelay`
3. `ReplayRelay`

There is no `AsyncRelay` because the `Relay` type does not support the terminal state.

### Relay
Emits all subsequent events to observers once they have subscribed.

```js
const relay = new Relay();

relay.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});

relay.next(1);
relay.next(2);

relay.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

relay.next(3);

```

Console output:
```none
observerA: 1
observerA: 2
observerA: 3
observerB: 3
```

### BehaviorRelay
Emits the most recent observed event and all subsequent events to observers once they have subscribed.

```js
const relay = new BehaviorRelay(0);

relay.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});

relay.next(1);
relay.next(2);

relay.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

relay.next(3);
```

Console output:

```none
observerA: 0
observerA: 1
observerA: 2
observerB: 2
observerA: 3
observerB: 3
```

### ReplayRelay
Emits all previously observed and subsequent events to observers once they have subscribed.

```js
const relay = new ReplayRelay();

relay.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});

relay.next(1);
relay.next(2);

relay.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

relay.next(3);
```

Console output:
```none
observerA: 1
observerA: 2
observerB: 1
observerB: 2
observerA: 3
observerB: 3
```
